  |   Developed by id Software, the studio that pioneered the               |
  |   first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM   |
  |   returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter          |
  |   experience. Relentless demons, impossibly destructive guns, and       |
  |   fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense,              |
  |   first-person combat - whether you're obliterating demon hordes        |
  |   through the depths of Hell in the single-player campaign, or          |
  |   competing against your friends in numerous multiplayer modes. There   |
  |   is no taking cover or stopping to regenerate health as you beat       |
  |   back Hell's raging demon hordes. Combine your arsenal of futuristic   |
  |   and iconic guns, upgrades, movement and an advanced melee system to   |
  |   knock-down, slash, stomp, crush, and blow apart demons in creative    |
  |   and violent ways.                                                     |
